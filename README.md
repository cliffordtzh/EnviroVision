# EnviroVision

SUMMARY:
Our team, EnviroVision, is proposing an innovative solution to reduce plastic waste and improve sustainability: a smart recycling bin system combined with a waste management analytics platform. The system uses computer vision and machine learning to sort recyclable and non-recyclable waste, while the platform provides real-time insights into waste disposal behavior and recommendations for optimizing waste management strategies.

We believe that our solution has the potential to revolutionize the way that businesses and governments manage waste, reducing plastic usage and improving sustainability outcomes.

PAIN POINTS:
1. Inefficient waste sorting and disposal: Traditional waste management methods often involve manual sorting of waste materials, which can be time-consuming and prone to error. This can result in recyclable materials being sent to landfills and non-recyclable materials being sent for recycling, which is inefficient and can contribute to environmental degradation. 
2. Lack of data-driven insights: Without real-time data on waste generation and disposal behavior, waste management strategies can be ineffective or inefficient. There is a need for a system that provides data-driven insights into waste management behavior, which can help businesses and governments make informed decisions about waste reduction and recycling efforts. 
3. Limited recycling infrastructure: Many areas lack the necessary recycling infrastructure to handle large volumes of waste materials. This can result in recyclable materials being sent to landfills, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose and contribute to environmental pollution. 
4. Climate change: The production and disposal of waste can contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing waste management and environmental sustainability is critical for mitigating the effects of climate change.

TARGET INDUSTRY: 
Our solution is targeted at businesses and governments that are looking to reduce their environmental footprint and improve sustainability outcomes. This includes companies in the retail, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, as well as local and national governments.

HOW IT WORKS:
The smart recycling bins are equipped with sensors and cameras that capture images of the materials being thrown away. The computer vision technology analyzes the images to identify the type of waste material and categorize it as recyclable or non-recyclable.

The computer vision system is trained using machine learning algorithms to recognize different types of materials, such as plastics, metals, glass, and paper. The more data the system collects, the better it becomes at identifying and sorting different materials.

Once the waste material has been identified and categorized, it is separated into different compartments within the bin, depending on whether it is recyclable or non-recyclable. This makes it easier for waste management personnel to collect and process the waste, as the recyclable materials can be sent for recycling and the non-recyclable materials can be sent for disposal.

Overall, the use of computer vision and machine learning technology in smart recycling bins enables more efficient and accurate sorting of waste materials, leading to improved waste management and recycling efforts.
