# EnviroVision

SUMMARY:

Our team, EnviroVision, is proposing an innovative solution to reduce plastic waste and improve sustainability: a smart recycling bin system combined with a waste management analytics platform. The system uses computer vision and machine learning to sort recyclable and non-recyclable waste, while the platform provides real-time insights into waste disposal behavior and recommendations for optimizing waste management strategies.

We believe that our solution has the potential to revolutionize the way that businesses and governments manage waste, reducing plastic usage and improving sustainability outcomes.

PAIN POINTS:

There are barriers in Singaporeâ€™s drive towards zero waste. For instance, Singaporeans are still generally unaware when it comes to recycling. This lack of knowledge contributes to a lowered domestic recycling rate and more commonly, leads to the contamination of recycled goods. The NEA states that 40% of recycling placed in blue bins gets contaminated by non-recyclables such as food waste and hence, cannot be recycled.

According to National Environment Agency 2022 Waste Statistics and Overall Recycling Table, 944,000 tonnes of plastic waste disposed and only around 6% of it is recycled in Singapore (2022). In addition, current waste management and recycling practices are often
inefficient and not designed to address waste segregation. 

1. Lack of Sorting: Traditional bins don't provide any sorting mechanism, which means all types of waste, recyclable and non-recyclable, are mixed together in the same bin. This can make it difficult and time-consuming to sort and process the waste properly.

2. Contamination: When recyclable and non-recyclable waste is mixed together, it can lead to contamination, rendering the recyclable materials unsuitable for recycling. This means that a lot of waste that could be recycled ends up in landfills or the natural environment.

3. Inefficient Disposal: Traditional bins are often not efficient in terms of space utilization, as they don't take into account the different types of waste generated. This can result in bins filling up quickly, leading to overflowing bins, littering, and unsanitary conditions.

4. Lack of Data: Traditional bins don't provide any data on the types and quantities of waste generated, or on waste disposal behavior. This makes it difficult to optimize waste management strategies and improve recycling programs. Without real-time data on waste generation and disposal behavior, waste management strategies can be ineffective or inefficient. There is a need for a system that provides data-driven insights into waste management behavior, which can help businesses and governments make informed decisions about waste reduction and recycling efforts.

5. Climate Change: The production and disposal of waste can contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing waste management and environmental sustainability is critical for mitigating the effects of climate change.

TARGET INDUSTRY: 

Our solution is targeted at businesses and governments that are looking to reduce their environmental footprint and improve sustainability outcomes. This includes companies in the retail, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, as well as local and national governments.

1. Businesses: Our smart recycling bin system and waste management analytics platform provide businesses with a comprehensive waste management solution that can help them reduce their environmental impact and improve their sustainability credentials. Our solution can be customized to meet the specific needs of each business, providing real-time insights into waste disposal behavior and recommendations for optimizing waste management strategies.

2. Government Agencies: Our solution can help government agencies to meet their sustainability targets and reduce their environmental impact. By providing real-time data on waste management practices, our solution can help government agencies to identify trends and develop effective waste management strategies. Additionally, our solution can help to reduce litter and illegal dumping, improving the appearance and cleanliness of public spaces.

HOW IT WORKS:

The smart recycling bins are equipped with sensors and cameras that capture images of the materials being thrown away. The computer vision technology analyzes the images to identify the type of waste material and categorize it as recyclable or non-recyclable.

The computer vision system is trained using machine learning algorithms to recognize different types of materials, such as plastics, metals, glass, and paper. The more data the system collects, the better it becomes at identifying and sorting different materials.

Once the waste material has been identified and categorized, it is separated into different compartments within the bin, depending on whether it is recyclable or non-recyclable. This makes it easier for waste management personnel to collect and process the waste, as the recyclable materials can be sent for recycling and the non-recyclable materials can be sent for disposal. Overall, the use of computer vision and machine learning technology in smart recycling bins enables more efficient and accurate sorting of waste materials, leading to improved waste management and recycling efforts.

Next, the analytics platform collects and processes data from the smart bins, including fill levels, waste composition, and disposal patterns. Machine learning algorithms analyze this data to generate valuable insights and metrics. Key metrics, such as total waste collected, recycling rate, landfill diversion rate, and others, provide an overview of waste management performance in real-time.

The analytics platform also incorporates historical data, allowing for trend analysis and identification of patterns over time. By analyzing historical data, the platform can identify waste generation patterns, peak usage periods, and optimize waste management strategies accordingly.

Furthermore, the platform leverages the power of data analytics to provide actionable recommendations. These recommendations can include optimizing waste collection routes to minimize fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions, identifying areas for improvement in recycling efforts, or suggesting behavior changes to promote sustainable waste disposal practices.

The waste management analytics platform empowers organizations to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights, leading to more efficient waste management, reduced environmental impact, and improved sustainability. By combining cutting-edge technologies with comprehensive data analysis, the platform revolutionizes waste management practices and contributes to a cleaner, greener future.
