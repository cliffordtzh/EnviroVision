# EnviroVision

Our team, EnviroVision, is proposing an innovative solution to reduce plastic waste and improve sustainability: a smart recycling bin system combined with a waste management analytics platform. The system uses computer vision and machine learning to sort recyclable and non-recyclable waste, while the platform provides real-time insights into waste disposal behavior and recommendations for optimizing waste management strategies.

We believe that our solution has the potential to revolutionize the way that businesses and governments manage waste, reducing plastic usage and improving sustainability outcomes.
